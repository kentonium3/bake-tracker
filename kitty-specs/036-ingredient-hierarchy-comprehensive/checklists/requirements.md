- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

## Notes

- This is a testing-focused feature (Phase 4 of F033-F036)
- Primary deliverable is verification of Phases 1-3, not new functionality
- User acceptance testing with Marianne is a key success criterion
- Test matrix derived from `docs/requirements/req_ingredients.md` Section 13
