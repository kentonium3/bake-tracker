# Specification Quality Checklist: Ingredient Hierarchy Taxonomy

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification derived from comprehensive design document at `docs/design/F031_ingredient_hierarchy.md`
- All 25 functional requirements mapped to user stories
- 7 success criteria defined with measurable metrics
- Parallelization opportunities documented for multi-agent development
- 5 assumptions explicitly documented
- 4 items marked as out of scope

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED - All checklist items complete
