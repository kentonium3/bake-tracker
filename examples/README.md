## Loading Test Data

```bash
# Initialize database and load test data
cd bake-tracker
python -m src.utils.load_test_data

# Or load a specific file
python -m src.utils.load_test_data examples/test_data_v2.json
```

## Conversion Process

The v2.0 file was created by:
1. Extracting recipes from scanned recipe sources (via AI)
2. Converting from v1.0 to v2.0 format using `convert_v1_to_v2.py`
3. Separating ingredients (generic) from variants (brand-specific)
4. Adding proper slug identifiers
5. Creating finished goods for all discrete-count recipes

## For Future Test Data Generation

When creating new test data:
1. Reference `docs/import_export_specification.md` (v2.0)
2. Ensure ingredients have `slug` and `recipe_unit` fields
3. Create separate `variants` array with `ingredient_slug` references
4. Recipe ingredients must use `ingredient_slug` (not `ingredient_name`)
5. Create finished goods for all discrete-count recipes

See `convert_v1_to_v2.py` for an example of the conversion process.
