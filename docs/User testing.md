* My Ingredients display almost unusable.
	* Hundreds of items, only shows four at a time
	* Information need to be much denser
	* Scroll bar needs to move window contents much more granularly
	* Categories inline with ingredient name is useless. 
	* Random order of ingredients is useless.
	* Need to be able to search/sort/filter by name and category
* Products listing unusable
	* On-screen density is good but scroll bar doesn't seem to move the contents
	* Location column not needed
	* Need to be able to search/sort/filter by name and category
	* Has a "Consume Ingredient" button but these are Products not Ingredients.
	* Product name column is showing the brand and it is concatenated with the package size. 
	* Column showing the ingredient display name, brand, and a column of product_unit_quantity and product_unit concatenated would make more sense. 
	* "Quantity" column is not intuitive to decipher. Maybe "Remaining quantity" would be better. Need to figure out how to represent something like 2.5 bags of flour (12.5 lbs) where both whole and partial packages are represented along with the total quantity.
* Import error summary
	* Display extends past bottom of the screen
	* Can't move the error dialogue window
	* No way to clear the display of the error dialogue
	* No easy way to capture the error.
	* Needs to write it to a log
