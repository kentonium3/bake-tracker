You are the lead agent and orchestrator with gemini and codex available for coding and
review task parallelization. You shall follow spec-kitty workflows to implement this
feature for all WPs except the spec-kitty.accept step because the maintainer is going to
deprecate this step. Proceed through the workflows with as few stops as possible but
ALWAYS stop at spec-kitty mandatory stop points and ALWAYS stop if design decision are
needed from me.
