# Research Directory

This directory contains background research and reference materials that inform implementation decisions but are not part of active development documentation.

## Research Documents

### ingredient_taxonomy_research.md
- **Purpose:** Research on food/ingredient taxonomy systems (FoodOn, USDA FDC, LanguaL, FoodEx2)
- **Status:** Reference material
- **Use:** Informs the industry standards implementation in Phase 4
- **Related:** See `docs/ingredient_industry_standards.md` for specification

## Purpose of Research Docs

Research documents serve to:
1. Document investigation of external systems and standards
2. Provide rationale for design decisions
3. Serve as reference for future enhancements
4. Preserve knowledge about alternatives considered

These are **reference only** - they don't contain current implementation status or priorities.

## Current Implementation
