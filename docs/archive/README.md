# Archive Directory

This directory contains historical documentation that has been superseded by consolidated documents.

## Archived Documents

### pause_point.md
- **Archived:** 2025-11-08
- **Reason:** Consolidated into `development_status.md` and `current_priorities.md`

## Why Archive?

These documents contained valuable information but created redundancy with the main status documents. They have been archived to:
1. Preserve historical context
2. Reduce documentation maintenance burden
3. Prevent conflicting information
4. Streamline for Spec-Kitty task generation
