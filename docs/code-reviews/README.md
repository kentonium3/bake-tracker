Files in the ./docs/code-review dir are for tracking prompts and reports of independent code reviews that augment the spec-kitty.review process. Evidence shows that independent reviews often find issues spe-kitty reviews miss so getting input from a different system makes for better code quality and more successful testing.

Claude Code code review prompt instructions for Cursor
Create a prompt for Cursor to perform an independent, thorough code review as a senior software engineer. Follow the prompt/report pattern of docs/code-reviews/cursor-F035*.md. Use full paths in file references. Have Cursor run the prompt’s verification commands (imports/greps/pytest) outside the sandbox (so venv activation won’t fail). If any command fails, have Cursor stop and report the blocker before fixing anything. Have Cursor write the report back to this same directory and not in the worktree.
