## Feature Descriptions

### Feature 022: Unit Reference Table & UI Constraints

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

**Problem:** Units were stored as free-form strings with application-level validation only. While TD-002 added import validation, the UI still allowed arbitrary unit entry.

**Solution:** Database-backed unit reference table with UI enforcement.

**Delivered:**
- Created `units` reference table with columns: `code`, `name`, `symbol`, `category`, `uncefact_code` (nullable)
- Seeded table with valid units from `src/utils/constants.py`
- Updated UI unit inputs to use dropdowns/comboboxes populated from units table
- Added application-level validation against reference table
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing data

**Reference Documents:**
- `docs/design/unit_codes_reference.md` - UN/CEFACT standard reference
- `docs/research/unit_handling_analysis_report.md` - Current state analysis
- `docs/technical-debt/TD-002_unit_standardization.md` - Prerequisite work

---

### Feature 023: Product Name Differentiation

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅ (Merged 2025-12-19)

**Problem:** Current unique constraint `(ingredient_id, brand, package_size, package_unit)` cannot distinguish product variants with identical packaging:
- Lindt 3.5oz bars at different cacao percentages (70% vs 85%)
- Sugar-free vs regular versions of same product
- Dairy variants (whole milk vs 2% vs skim)

**Solution:** Add `product_name` field for human-readable product differentiation.

**Scope:**
- Add `product_name VARCHAR(200) NULL` column to Product table
- Update unique constraint to include product_name: `(ingredient_id, brand, product_name, package_size, package_unit)`
- Maintain backward compatibility (nullable for existing products)
- Enable AI-assisted backfilling of product names
- Support mobile barcode scanning workflow for web phase

**Web Phase Alignment:**
This change directly enables critical mobile inventory management:
- GTIN lookup returns complete product info including readable product_name
- Mobile app displays clear differentiation: "Ghirardelli 60% Cacao 3.5oz bar"
- User confirms or edits before adding to inventory
- Reduces manual data entry friction (adoption blocker)

**Migration Strategy:** Export/reset/import cycle (Constitution VI)

**Complexity Justification:**
- **Future-Proof Schema:** Aligns with GS1 industry practices; enables barcode workflow
- **User-Centric Design:** Clear product identification; critical for mobile UX
- **Pragmatic Aspiration:** Desktop nullable/optional; Web critical for adoption

---

### Feature 020: Enhanced Data Import

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅ (Merged 2025-12-16)

**Problem:** Current unified import conflates two fundamentally different data types:
- **Catalog Data** (Ingredients, Products, Recipes) - slowly changing reference data
- **Transactional Data** (Purchases, Inventory, Events) - user-specific activity

This prevents safe catalog expansion without risking user data.

**Solution:** Separate import pathways with explicit modes:
- `ADD_ONLY` - Create new records, skip existing (default)
- `AUGMENT` - Update NULL fields on existing records (ingredients/products only)

**Delivered:**
- New `import_catalog` CLI command
- Catalog-specific JSON format (v1.0)
- FK validation before import
- Dry-run preview mode
- Preserved existing unified import/export for development workflow

**Specification:** `docs/enhanced_data_import.md`

---

### Feature 021: Field Naming Consistency

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅ (Merged 2025-12-16)

**Problem:** Two naming inconsistencies created confusion:
1. **Purchase vs Package:** `purchase_unit` and `purchase_quantity` on Product describe package characteristics, not purchase transactions.
2. **Pantry remnants:** "Pantry" terminology should have been fully replaced by "Inventory" but remnants remained.

**Delivered:**
- Renamed `purchase_unit` → `package_unit`
- Renamed `purchase_quantity` → `package_unit_quantity`
- Replaced all "pantry" occurrences with "inventory"
- Updated schema, models, services, UI, import/export, docs, tests

---

### Feature 017: Reporting & Event Planning

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅ (Merged 2025-12-12)

**Rationale:** With event-production linkage complete (Feature 016), accurate event reporting is now possible.

**Delivered:**
- Shopping list CSV export
- Event summary reports (planned vs actual)
- Cost analysis views
- Recipient history reports
- Dashboard enhancements

**Spec-Kitty Artifacts:** `kitty-specs/017-reporting-event-planning/`

---

### Feature 016: Event-Centric Production Model

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅ (Merged 2025-12-11)

**Problem Solved:** The architecture previously conflated three distinct concerns:
1. **Definition** - What IS a Cookie Gift Box? (FinishedGood + Composition) ✅
2. **Inventory** - How many EXIST globally? (inventory_count) ✅
3. **Commitment** - How many are FOR Christmas 2025? ✅ **NOW WORKS**

**Delivered (Schema v0.6):**
- Added `event_id` (nullable FK) to ProductionRun and AssemblyRun
- New `EventProductionTarget` table (event_id, recipe_id, target_batches)
- New `EventAssemblyTarget` table (event_id, finished_good_id, target_quantity)
- Added `fulfillment_status` ENUM to EventRecipientPackage (pending/ready/delivered)
- Service methods for target management and progress calculation
- UI: Event selector in Record Production/Assembly dialogs
- UI: Targets tab in Event detail with progress bars
- UI: Fulfillment status column with sequential workflow

**Design Document:** `docs/design/schema_v0.6_design.md`
**Spec-Kitty Artifacts:** `kitty-specs/016-event-centric-production/`

---

### BUGFIX: Session Management Remediation

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅ (2025-12-11)

**Problem Solved:** Code review during Feature 016 revealed critical architectural flaw: nested `session_scope()` calls cause SQLAlchemy objects to become detached, resulting in silent data loss.

**Delivered:**
- Fixed `assembly_service.py` to pass session through call chain
- Fixed `check_can_produce()` and `check_can_assemble()` to use session parameter
- Rollback tests already existed (TestTransactionAtomicity, TestAssemblyTransactionAtomicity)
- All 680 tests pass

**Specification:** `docs/design/session_management_remediation_spec.md`

---

### Feature 018: Event Production Dashboard

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅ (Merged 2025-12-12)

**Rationale:** Builds on Feature 016's event progress tracking to provide a comprehensive "mission control" view.

**Delivered:**
- "Where do I stand for Christmas 2025?" consolidated view
- Progress bars per recipe/finished good
- Fulfillment status tracking with visual indicators
- Multi-event overview (compare progress across events)
- Quick actions (jump to record production, view shopping list)

**Spec-Kitty Artifacts:** `kitty-specs/018-event-production-dashboard/`

---

### Feature 012: Nested Recipes

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

**Rationale:** User testing revealed recipes can be hierarchical. A frosted layer cake recipe calls for sub-recipes (chocolate cake layers, vanilla cake layers, frosting, filling).

**Scope (Delivered):**
- `RecipeComponent` junction model (recipe_id, component_recipe_id, quantity, unit, notes)
- Recursive recipe cost calculation
- Recursive ingredient aggregation for shopping lists
- Recipe UI: ability to add sub-recipes as components
- Import/export support for nested recipes

---

### Feature 019: Unit Conversion Simplification

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅ (Merged 2025-12-14)

**Problem:** Redundant unit conversion mechanisms:
- `Ingredient.recipe_unit` - vestigial field; recipes declare their own units in RecipeIngredient
- `UnitConversion` table - values derivable from 4-field density on Ingredient

**Solution:** Remove both. The 4-field density model (Feature 010) is the canonical source.

**Delivered:**
- Deleted `Ingredient.recipe_unit` column
- Deleted `UnitConversion` model and table
- Updated import/export spec v3.2 → v3.3
- Converted test data files
- Constitution v1.2.0: Schema changes via export/reset/import (no migration scripts)

**Specification:** `docs/feature_019_unit_simplification.md`

---

### Feature 024: Unified Import Error Handling

**Status:** COMPLETE ✅ (Merged 2025-12-20)

**Problem:** Import error handling was inconsistent between unified import and catalog import:
- **Unified Import:** Scrollable dialog with copy-to-clipboard, log files written to `docs/user_testing/`
- **Catalog Import:** Basic messageboxes, errors truncated to 5, no logging, rich `suggestion` field not displayed

**Solution:** Standardize error display across both import systems:
- Use `ImportResultsDialog` for all imports (scrollable, copyable)
- Write log files for catalog imports (matching unified import format)
- Display structured error suggestions when available
- Show relative paths (not absolute) for log file locations

**Delivered:**
- Catalog import uses `ImportResultsDialog` instead of messageboxes
- All errors displayed (not truncated to 5)
- Log files written to `docs/user_testing/import_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log`
- Error suggestions displayed clearly in dialog and logs
- Relative paths shown in UI (not absolute)
- Consistent user experience across import types

**Specification:** `docs/design/F024_unified_import_error_handling.md`

---

### Feature 026: Deferred Packaging Decisions

**Status:** READY 📋

**Problem:** When planning events, food decisions precede packaging aesthetic decisions. Current system forces premature commitment to specific packaging designs (e.g., snowflake vs holly bags) when only generic requirements are known (e.g., need 6" cellophane bags).

**Solution:** Allow planning with generic packaging products, deferring specific material selection until later in the workflow:
- Event planning: Select generic packaging product (e.g., "Cellophane Bags 6x10")
- System shows: Available inventory across variants, estimated cost (average price)
- Decision timing: Anytime from planning through assembly (assembly forces decision)
- Material assignment: Quick assign interface or full assignment screen
- Cost updates: Estimated (generic) → Actual (assigned)

**Delivered:**
- Radio button UI: "Specific material" vs "Generic product" selection
- EventPackagingRequirement and EventPackagingAssignment tables
- Production dashboard indicator for pending packaging decisions
- Assembly definition screen with material assignment interface
- Assembly progress enforcement with "Record Anyway" bypass option
- Shopping list shows generic products until materials assigned
- Dynamic cost estimates (average for generic, actual for assigned)

**Edge Cases Covered:**
- Change of plans during assembly (boxes → bags)
- Insufficient inventory at assignment time
- Multiple refinement stages
- Shopping before final assignment
- Backfill scenarios for fast-moving kitchen

**User Validation:** All acceptance criteria validated with primary stakeholder (Marianne). Covers all discussed real-world scenarios.

**Design Document:** `docs/design/F026-deferred-packaging-decisions.md`

---

### Feature 025: Production Loss Tracking

**Status:** DESIGN 📋

**Problem:** Baked goods production involves real-world failures (burnt, broken, contaminated, dropped). Current system cannot distinguish between successful production and losses, preventing cost accounting for waste and analytics on loss trends.

**Solution:** Add explicit production loss tracking with:
- Loss quantity and category (burnt/broken/contaminated/dropped/wrong_ingredients/other)
- Production status enum (COMPLETE/PARTIAL_LOSS/TOTAL_LOSS)
- Yield balance constraint: actual_yield + loss_quantity = expected_yield
- Separate ProductionLoss table for detailed loss records and analytics
- UI auto-calculates loss quantity from expected vs actual yield
- Cost breakdown showing good units vs lost units

**Delivered:**
- Schema: production_status, loss_quantity, loss_notes on ProductionRun
- New ProductionLoss model with loss_category, costs, notes
- Service layer: record_production() accepts loss parameters
- UI: RecordProductionDialog shows loss details section, cost breakdown
- Reporting: Loss summaries by category, recipe loss rates, waste cost analysis

**Design Document:** `docs/design/F025_production_loss_tracking.md`

---

### Feature 027: Packaging & Distribution

**Status:** Blocked (awaiting user testing completion)

**Scope:** PyInstaller executable, Inno Setup installer, Windows distribution.
