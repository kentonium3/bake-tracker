# Gemini Project Overview: Seasonal Baking Tracker

This document provides an overview of the "Seasonal Baking Tracker" project, generated by the Gemini CLI to serve as instructional context for future interactions.

## Project Overview

The Seasonal Baking Tracker is a desktop application designed to assist with managing various aspects of holiday baking operations. It provides functionalities for tracking ingredient inventory with flexible unit conversions, managing recipes with automatic cost calculation, planning gift packages and bundles, tracking recipients and deliveries, generating shopping lists, and monitoring production.

**Key Technologies:**
*   **Python 3.10+**: The primary programming language.
*   **CustomTkinter**: Modern UI framework for the desktop application.
*   **SQLite**: Local database for data storage.
*   **SQLAlchemy**: Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for database interaction.
*   **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and CSV export capabilities.

**Project Type:** Software Development (Python Desktop Application)

## Building and Running

The project uses a `venv` for dependency management and a `Makefile` for convenience commands.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10 or higher installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kentonium3/bake-tracker.git
    cd bake-tracker
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    *   **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   **macOS/Linux:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    make install
    ```
    (This runs `venv/Scripts/pip.exe install -r requirements.txt`)

### Running the Application

To start the desktop application:
```bash
make run
```
(This runs `venv/Scripts/python.exe src/main.py`)

## Development Conventions

The project follows standard Python development practices and uses several tools for code quality and testing, configured via `pyproject.toml` and `pytest.ini`.

### Testing

*   **Framework**: `pytest`
*   **Test Location**: Tests are located in the `src/tests` directory.
*   **Running Tests**:
    *   To run all tests: `make test`
    *   To run tests with a coverage report: `make test-cov`
*   **Test Markers**: Tests are categorized with markers such as `unit`, `integration`, `slow`, and `ui` (for tests requiring manual interaction).

### Code Formatting

*   **Tool**: `Black`
*   **Configuration**: Defined in `pyproject.toml` (line length 100).
*   **Formatting Command**: `make format`

### Linting & Type Checking

*   **Linters**: `flake8` and `mypy`
*   **Configuration**: `mypy` configuration is in `pyproject.toml`.
*   **Linting Command**: `make lint` (runs `flake8` and `mypy`)

### Project Structure (Key Directories)

*   `src/`: Main application source code.
    *   `models/`: Database models.
    *   `services/`: Business logic.
    *   `ui/`: User interface components.
    *   `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
    *   `tests/`: Application test suite.
*   `data/`: Placeholder for the SQLite database, created at runtime.
